# Helix

**Build reactive web interfaces in OCaml.**

> Note: this project is experimental. The core functionality is stable but the
> API may break before the official release.

[**API Docs**](https://rizo.github.io/helix/helix/Helix/index.html) â€¢ [**Examples**](https://github.com/rizo/helix/tree/master/examples)

## Features

- Reactive signals with
  [`signal`](https://github.com/rizo/signal): signals represent values that change over time and can be used to model any dynamic state in your application.
- Declarative HTML with [`Helix.Html`](https://rizo.github.io/helix/helix/Helix/Html/index.html): write your HTML templates directly in OCaml.
- Fine-grained reactivity without Virtual DOM using
  [`Helix.View`](https://rizo.github.io/helix/helix/Helix/View/index.html): updates are directly applied to the DOM tree based on values emited by reactive signals.
- Js-compatibility library [`jx`](https://github.com/rizo/jx): write bindings to interact withe the JavaScript ecosystem.


## Example

```ocaml
open Helix
open Stdweb

let counter () =
  let incr = Signal.make 0 in
  let count = Signal.reduce (fun total n -> total + n) 0 incr in
  let open Html in
  fragment
    [
      h2 [ style [ ("font-family", "monospace") ] ] [ text "Counter" ];
      div [ style [ ("margin-bottom", "20px") ] ] [ text "Compute a count." ];
      div []
        [
          button [ on_click (fun _ -> Signal.emit 1 incr) ] [ text "+" ];
          button [ on_click (fun _ -> Signal.emit (-1) incr) ] [ text "-" ];
          span [ style [ ("margin-left", "5px") ] ] [ View.show int count ];
        ];
    ]

let () =
  match Dom.Document.get_element_by_id "root" with
  | Some root -> Html.render root (counter ())
  | None -> failwith "No #root element found"
```


## Roadmap

- Add support for [Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange).
- JSX ppx for Reason.
  - Currently blocked by https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7104.
- Implement a JSX PPX for [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io).
  - WIP implementation: https://github.com/rizo/helix/tree/master/experiments/helix-ppx.
- Server-side rendering.
- Support for scoped CSS styling using web-components.
